        <!-- <h3>ABOUT ME</h3> -->
        <p>
          Hello! I am a second-year student at Georgia Tech majoring in Computer
          Science and minoring in both Math and Economics.
        </p>
        <p>
          At college, I am focusing on developing strong quantitative skills to
          apply towards computational social science research. Using the
          abundance of data available today detailing human behavior, I endeavor
          to inform decisions that will make a progressive social impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research explores the role of social media in public discourse,
          currently focusing on modeling the language of online conspiracy
          theory communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am looking for work or research opportunities this summer. Feel free
          to reach out if you think I would be a good fit!
        </p>

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <h3>MY DEGREE</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently a sophomore at the Georgia Institute of Technology in
          Atlanta. As a member of the Honors Program, I am a motivated student
          with a 4.0 GPA pursuing a rigorous course load. I love to learn, and
          will likely continue my education in graduate school. I will graduate
          in the spring of 2023 with three degrees:
        </p>
        <h2>1. Major in Computer Science</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          I have built a strong programming foundation with object oriented
          programming, data structures, and algorithms. Now, I am beginning my
          upper-level coursework where I am concentrating in Intelligence and
          Theory.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          With the Intelligence thread, I am exploring human cognitive processes
          through psychology courses, and learning how to apply these concepts
          with artificial intelligence and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Through my Theory classes, I am investigating the mathematical
          underpinnings of computer science.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Minor in Mathematics</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          Modeling complex systems like markets or social climate requires a
          strong grasp of mathematical statistics and analysis. Paired with my
          Theory thread, this degree will help me build strong analytical skills
          that will enable me to work with data in any capacity.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Minor in Economics</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          Through the lens of economic analysis, I hope to build the necessary
          background to apply my quantitative skills to social sciences in my
          graduate education and career.

        <h3>WORK</h3>

        <h2>Research Intern, Georgia Tech Research Institute</h2>
        <h4>Atlanta, GA - May 2020 to Present</h4>
        <p>
          To enable our team of social scientists to collect social media data,
          I built a GUI application that accesses the Twitter API and performs
          sentiment analysis with tweet data. I am currently working on
          expanding our tools to work with Reddit data. As an individual
          project, I collected 500,000 tweets from Congress members during the
          pandemic to identify partisan differences in public health topic
          attention and attitudes.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <!-- <img src="images/icons8-external-link-50.png" alt="" /> -->
          Research Assistant, Internet Governance Project
        </h2>
        <h4>Atlanta, GA - May 2020 to Present</h4>
        <p>
          Working under the Georgia Tech School of Public Policy, I conducted a
          literature review on how social media algorithms affect the content in
          usersâ€™ feeds. Here, I collected over one hundred studies, reporting on
          their methodologies and findings. In this analysis, I developed a deep
          understanding of the roles these platforms play in amplifying fake
          news, polarization, and radicalization.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>PROJECTS</h3>

        <h2>Notes Application</h2>
        <h4>Coming soon!</h4>
        <p>
          I am currently working on creating a web application using React where
          users can create an annotated bibliography for the content the consume
          in their day to day life. Using an LDA machine learning algorithm, I
          aim to connect notes with similar concepts to model knowledge similar
          to how our brain stores information.
